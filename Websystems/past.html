    <p>During Year 11 and 12, I studied Computer Science 
        for the International Baccalaureate (IB).</p>
    <p>Over the course of the year we had to learn about a number of computer processes
        , such as the machine insturction cycle, as well as hardware components of a compter.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I learned how to code in the following computer languages:

                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Pseudocode</li>
                <li>HTML and CSS</li>

    <h2>IB Project</h2>
    <p>As part of my course work I had to design a fully functioning database and GUI
        for my Year 12 Project. As I was most familiar with it I used Python and the application
        SQLite for my database to run on.
    </p>
    <p>The primary goal of my database was:
        <ol>
            <li>Create a database recieve Inputs for swimming times</li>
            <li>Create a GUI to act as a place to input these times and to 
                export them in a visual format</li>
            <li>Expain the processes of the program in a report</li>
        </ol>
