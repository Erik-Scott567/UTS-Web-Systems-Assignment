    <ol>
        <li>Headers</li>
        <p>The headers contain links to the other websites and acts
            as the main form of navigation between all the webpages.
            All the headers are wrapped in the div, .sections. The class
            is then edited in the css file to make it stand out within
            the webpages.
        </p>
        <li>Main Body</li>
        <p>Under each header on every webpage contains the main section
            of the page. This sections is divided into its own div class so that it can
            be stylised derivatively from the rest of the page via the
            use of css.
        </p>
        <li>Footer</li>
        <p>After the main content of the webpage, the bottom
            of the webpage contains a footer holding my student details. The text 
            within the footer uses the .foot class.
        </p>
        <p>The text within the footer in encased by the footer element
             in order to distinguish it from the rest of the webpage.

            <div class="color_text">
<p>I wanted to choose a calming color pallet for my website 
    and so going for a scheme consisting of different shades
     of blue felt the most appropriate.
</p>
<p>Not to mention, that the color blue links quite heavilt to my 
    main sport of swimming so I felt like it matched more 
    with my personal interests.
</p>
            </div>
    </div>

<h4><span style="color:skyblue">Font</span></h4>
<p>For the website look, I decided to go with the font Arial for the most part. This
     is beacuse it looked the most appealing to me and its simple
      look works well with the websites color scheme. <p>However, I did utilise Times New Roman
       for some headings and bullet points for some variety.</p>
</p>
<h3><span style="color:grey">Accessibility</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative</a> is 
a set of guidline to help web devlopers create their webpages to be equally accessible
 to everybody.</p>
 <h4><span style="color:skyblue">Font</span></h4>
 <p>For the font selection I decided to utilise Arial for the 
    majority of the website as it is an easier font to read and is 
    visually appealing.
 </p>
 <p>In order to have some variety, I have chosen to also use 
    Times New Roman for a couple of headings and dot points in 
    order to create visual variety between the presented information.
 </p>
 <p>Therefore, making it easier to read and take in the information provided
     on the website.
 </p>
 <h4><span style="color:skyblue">Font Size</span></h4>
 <p>In order to make the website more readable, I chose to use
     a larger font size than I originally anticipated.
 </p>
 <p>This made the website more accessible to those who may have been 
    unable to read the webpages at their original font size.
 </p>
 <p>Additionally, this also helps to create a more visually appealing look
     for the website and makes the information easier to read and less like 
     a chore to get through.
