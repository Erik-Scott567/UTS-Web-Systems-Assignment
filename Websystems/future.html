    <h2>Immediate Plans</h2>
    <p>Currently, I'm studying IT at UTS but I'm yet to decide
        what I wish to major in. However, I am faily certain
        I want to major in a more coding focused subject area.
    </p>
    <p>Right now my immeditae goals are to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Perform Well in my current Subjects</li>
        <li>Progress my current skills in Programming</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Short Term Plans</h2>
    <p>In terms of my plans within the following 2 years, I am 
        currently aiming to major in subjects more directed at 
        programming and problem solving.
    </p>
    <p>These are subject areas in which I feel like I have the most
         strengths and are also areas in which I find myself enjoying 
         the work the most. However, I have yet to decide what specfic major to focus in on 
         but I am planning to solidify this decsion soon.

         of a plan If I'm being honest.

    <p>However, I definatly want a job which has a big 
        focus on problem solving and maybe elements of coding.
    </p>
    <p>Although, In terms of none computing related plans, I am planning
         to continue to improve upon my swimming.
    </p>
    <p>My main ambition currently is to reach the 2024 Olympic Trials 
        for swimming and I'm definatly on track to do so If I maintain 
        my current work rate.
    </p>
    <p>However, This doesn't mean I still won't make plans for my IT future 
        as by 2024 I should have a good idea of what I want to focus on and aim for :)
